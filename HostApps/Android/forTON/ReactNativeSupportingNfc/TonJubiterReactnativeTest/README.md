The first version of React native Android app to test work with NFC cards. It also contains even the stuff for Bluetooth cards. We thought that we need a module working with both technologies. But little later we removed it
bacause we decided to handle only NFC for now. This proj could be deleted if there are no references on it in some old cards at Review column.
