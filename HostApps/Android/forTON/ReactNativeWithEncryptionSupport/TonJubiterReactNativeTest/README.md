Some old version of react native app for Ã€ndroid to test Bluetooth cards. Some messy stuff for encryption (AES, Diffie Hellman) was added into it. 
At some point of time we wanted to implement some part of Tweetnacl lib in applet and respectively in native modules.
Later we reformulated the technical task. So this is unnecessary stuff anymore.
So this project is really  not used and can be deleted if there are no old cards in Review column referencing it.
