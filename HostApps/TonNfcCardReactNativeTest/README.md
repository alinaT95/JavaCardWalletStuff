Here there is a old exemplery React native project that was prepared to demonstrate work of NFC card and Android smartphone. It is not used already. 
The most up todate React Native app to test work with NFC card and iPhone/Android lives now here https://github.com/tonlabs/TonNfcCardReactNativeTest.

But some old cards (summer 2020) at Integration board probably still have references onto this project.
