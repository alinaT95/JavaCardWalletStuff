This repo contains a collection of different apps and projects related to security cards.
In the past all security card stuff lived here. But now the major parts are moved into separate repos:

1) Up to date Ton Wallet applet now is here https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-wallet-applet

2) Android/iOS npm lib for NFC is here https://github.com/tonlabs/react-native-new-ton-nfc-card-lib

3) React native App to test work with NFC card for Android/iPhone is here https://github.com/tonlabs/TonNfcCardReactNativeTest

4) React native App for stress testing of NFC card is here https://github.com/tonlabs/TonNfcCardLibTestApp

5) Java host app WalletClientApp to interact with NFC cards is renamed and moved into https://github.com/tonlabs/TonWalletJavaHostApp

So mainly projects in repo TON-JavaCardWalletStuff contain some old code that is not updated already. 
Here you may find our old Android projects to work with Bluetooth smart cards. Probably we will need it in the future. 
Also here there are different apps and projects given to us by Feitian in a different period of time.
And you may find here some interesting simple working examplary Swift apps for NFC smart cards/NDEF tags.

Inside each project you may find a readme describing it. Later part of these projects will be deleted (because they contain redundant duplicated code) 
after finishing the review of some old cards at Integration board.
