This app was created for testing card activation in the case when Surf developer does not have a card yet. 
It contains android/ios mocks for some functions that are implemented in NFC library  https://github.com/tonlabs/react-native-new-ton-nfc-card-lib (like turnOnWallet, getPublicKeyForDefaultPath etc) for real NFC card activation. It imitates NFC connection and mocks potential responses from card.

Now our developers work with real cards already. So this app is not used anymore.
